					<description><![CDATA[Glossitis is typically characterized by an inflammation of the tongue. It can also cause changes in the tongue's texture and color.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Along with swelling, glossitis can change the color and surface texture of the tongue because the condition causes the small bumps on the surface to shrink, creating a shiny, red surface.</p>
<p>Severe cases of glossitis can be painful and affect the way a person talks or eats.</p>
<p>There are different types of glossitis, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acute glossitis.</strong> This often develops suddenly and can have severe symptoms.</li>
<li><strong>Chronic glossitis.</strong> Chronic inflammation of the tongue is often the result of an underlying condition.</li>
<li><strong>Atrophic glossitis also called Hunter&#8217;s glossitis.</strong> Here, the many of the tongue&#8217;s small bumps (papillae) shrink, which changes the surface of the tongue, making it appear glossy.</li>
<li><strong>Median rhomboid glossitis.</strong> A Candida yeast infection often causes this type of glossitis.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<p>The symptoms of glossitis vary from person to person. They may also differ according to the underlying cause of the condition.</p>
<p>Common symptoms of glossitis include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a swollen tongue</li>
<li>pain in the tongue</li>
<li>burning or itching in the tongue</li>
<li>change in the texture of the surface of the tongue due to the change in the size and shape of papillae</li>
<li>different color of the tongue&#8217;s surface</li>
<li>loss of ability to speak or eat properly</li>
<li>difficulty swallowing</li>
</ul>
<h3>Causes</h3>
<p>There is a variety of possible causes of glossitis, including:</p>
<h4>Allergic reaction</h4>
<p>When glossitis occurs due to an allergic reaction, a person is most likely to develop acute glossitis and have sudden tongue swelling and pain. An allergy to a particular food, drug, or specific irritant can cause this type of reaction.</p>
<h4>Injury to the mouth</h4>
<p>Injuries to the mouth, such as small cuts from braces or burns from hot food, might cause the tongue to inflame and swell.</p>
<p>When dental braces cause glossitis, a person is more at risk for chronic glossitis due to the risk of repeated injury to the mouth and tongue.</p>
<h4>Diseases</h4>
<p>Certain diseases can cause glossitis, especially those where nutritional deficiencies occur, such as celiac disease, protein-calorie malnutrition, and pernicious anemia.</p>
<p>Diseases that attack the immune system, such as Sj√∂gren&#8217;s Syndrome, can cause changes in the mouth that lead to glossitis.</p>
<h4>Infections</h4>
<p>Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections can all cause glossitis. However, oral herpes, which is a viral infection, and fungal yeast infections are among the most likely infections to cause glossitis.</p>
<h4>Nutritional deficiencies</h4>
<p>Iron deficiencies occur when a person does not have enough iron in their blood. This can trigger glossitis since low levels of iron lead to low levels of myoglobin, a substance in the blood that plays a significant role in the health of all the muscles in the body, including the tongue.</p>
